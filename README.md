📊 DSA Projects

This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) projects, each designed to demonstrate, visualize, and reinforce core computer science concepts through hands-on implementations.

🧩 Project Overview
1️⃣ Algorithm Visualizer – Maze Runner

📁 Folder: algo_visualizer

🔍 Purpose

The Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive maze-solving application that visually demonstrates how different pathfinding algorithms work step by step. It helps learners understand the behavior, efficiency, and decision-making process of popular graph traversal algorithms.

🧠 Algorithms Implemented

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS)

A* (A-Star) Pathfinding Algorithm

Each algorithm explores the maze differently, allowing users to clearly see:

Order of node exploration

Path selection logic

Performance differences

✨ Features

Interactive graphical UI for real-time visualization

Step-by-step animation of algorithm execution

Maze generation and traversal

Clear comparison between BFS, DFS, and A*

Beginner-friendly way to understand graph algorithms
