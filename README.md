📊 DSA Projects
This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) projects, each designed to demonstrate, visualize, and reinforce core computer science concepts through hands-on implementations.
🧩 Project Overview
1️⃣ Algorithm Visualizer – Maze Runner
📁 Folder: algo_visualizer
🔍 Purpose
The Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive maze-solving application that visually demonstrates how different pathfinding algorithms work step by step. It helps learners understand the behavior, efficiency, and decision-making process of popular graph traversal algorithms.
🧠 Algorithms Implemented
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Depth-First Search (DFS)
A* (A-Star) Pathfinding Algorithm
Each algorithm explores the maze differently, allowing users to clearly see:
Order of node exploration
Path selection logic
Performance differences
✨ Features
Interactive graphical UI for real-time visualization
Step-by-step animation of algorithm execution
Maze generation and traversal
Clear comparison between BFS, DFS, and A*
Beginner-friendly way to understand graph algorithms
